 # DESCRIPTION
 In the modern digital era, people spend an increasing amount of time on web browsers—whether it's for work, study, entertainment, or casual browsing. However, this flexibility often leads to inefficient time management, distractions, and reduced productivity. To address this challenge, the Chrome Time Tracker and Productivity Analytics project was developed as a browser-based tool that empowers users to monitor and optimize their online activities.

This project is a Chrome Extension designed to seamlessly integrate with the user's browser and operate in the background. Its main functionality is to track the amount of time spent on various websites and present that data in a meaningful way through a popup dashboard and analytics reports. The goal is to create awareness about time usage habits and help users make informed decisions to enhance their productivity.

The extension begins tracking time automatically once the user installs and enables it. It detects tab focus and monitors active tabs to identify where the user is spending the most time. Every time a user switches tabs or becomes inactive, the extension accurately logs this data without intruding on the user’s experience.

The user interface of the extension includes a popup window that displays real-time data such as the total time spent today, top 5 websites visited, and a pie chart showing the percentage of time across categories (like social media, work, entertainment, etc.). A reset or refresh button allows the user to clear or update stats. This interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a smooth and intuitive user experience.

The project also incorporates local storage or Chrome’s chrome.storage API to persist time-tracking data even after the browser is closed. More advanced versions of the extension may support daily/weekly reports, export to CSV, focus mode alerts, or even goal setting, such as “limit social media to 1 hour per day.”

In terms of productivity analysis, the tool offers categorization of websites, allowing users to classify URLs under labels like "Work", "Leisure", "News", "Social Media", etc. Based on time spent in each category, the extension calculates a daily productivity score. Over time, users can track trends and adjust their habits accordingly.
